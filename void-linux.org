* Introduction
There are 2 obvious areas of Void Linux that distinguishes it from
other Linux distributions: =runit=, its process management daemon and
=xbps=, its package manager.

Over time, I will also cover other areas, but these are the obvious
places to familiarize oneself for Void Linux.

* xbps
