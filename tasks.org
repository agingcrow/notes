#+BEGIN_VERSE
21
But now the righteousness of God
apart from the law
is revealed,
being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets

22
even the righteousness of God,
through faith in Jesus Christ,
to all and on all who believe.
For there is no difference;

23
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

24 being justified freely by His grace
through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus

25
whom God set forth
as a propitiation by His blood,
through faith,
to demonstrate His righteousness,
because in His forbearance
God had passed over the sins
that were previously committed,

26
to demonstrate at the present time
His righteousness,
that He might be just and the justifier of the one
who has faith in Jesus.

https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/your-concentration-training-program-11-exercises-that-will-strengthen-your-attention/
https://www.successconsciousness.com/index_000005.htm

*** Exercise 1

Take a book or a magazine and count the number of words in a single
paragraph. Count them again to ensure that you have counted
correctly. You can start off with one paragraph and as you get used to
it, move on to counting words in two paragraphs. Then move on to
counting words on the whole page. Make sure that you perform the
counting mentally and only with your eyes without pointing your finger
at each word. This is one of the simplest brain exercises to improve
concentration.

*** Exercise 2

Another exercise to increase concentration is count backwards in your
mind from hundred to one. Once you have mastered this, move on to
counting backwards from hundred to one but this time skipping three
numbers such as 100, 97, 94, 91, 88 etc.

*** Exercise 3

Select an inspiring word or just a simple sound and think about it in
your mind, repeating it in your mind for 5 minutes. Once your mind has
begun to concentrate on it easily, move on to 10 minutes of
uninterrupted concentration.

*** Exercise 4

Try to suppress your thoughts for at least 5 minutes. This appears
pretty tough, but with regular practice, you can do it. Start off with
one minute and gradually increase the length of time. Try your best to
stay blank for 5 minutes without a single thought in your mind. This
will take time, but gradually you will improve and thus your
concentration will also excel. Donâ€™t try to push yourself if you find
it difficult initially. Just try to give your best. Once you are
finished with it, stop and try again the next day. This is one of the
most difficult exercise for concentration.

** Verse Memorization App concept
*** Name

- versefriends
- memverse.com
- myverses

*** Concept

1. You pick verses that you want to memorize, which translation, which
   language, etc.
2. You can disable punctuation, case-sensitivity, American vs. British
   orthography relaxation
3. You type them into a textarea and you get "marked"
   dynamically/real-time
4. If you get the verses right over a certain threshold (let's say
   90%), then you can post these verses on a twitter-like feed
5. It will automatically remind you and quiz you everyday which verses
   you have to type in--there is some scheduling.
6. You get ranked like in Duolingo
- typing speed
- how many verses you get right

*** Behind the scenes

- It stores diffs of the original verse

*** Two types of accounts

- private accounts with no names
- Named accounts

*** Access

- android app
- IOS app
